This is a simple text file indicating what work needs to be done to progress with the project


Note: I am missing some components of the game, just add them if you see a game mechanic not present.



Create a text visualization of the current board:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This should be a function of its own which prints out the current board layout. The board layout includes:
    - all of the current territories
    - the number of clans in each territory
    - if the festival is in a territory
    - if a clan is in a citadel
    - number of sanctuaries in a territory
    - which side the crow is flipped (clockwise or counterclockwise)
    - how many deeds each player has
    - who is the Brenn
    - how many Epic Tale (RED), Advantage (YELLOW), and Action (GREEN) cards each player has (and which player has which advantage cards)



Create a method to handle deck building phase of the game:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This function should be called at the start of each turn:
(This might be challenging to work through locally because it involves everyone selecting cards, and then passing to another player;
how would we do this with a one-at-a-time local turn system elegantly?)
    


Create a method to initiate a clash:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This should be a function which walks through a clash between two or more players in a territory
(I have no clue how we would implement this, I don't remember how clashes work lol)
